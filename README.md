## Course Philosophy

This course focuses on building mental models to represent complex engineering concepts.

* **Experimentation & Effort over Perfection:** You are assessed on your process and attempt, not on creating a flawless masterpiece.
* **Exploration:** Use this time to explore new tools (including AI help if desired), have *FUN*, and find what works for your thinking style.
* **No "Failing":** There is no wrong way to visualize your thoughts and mental models, provided you are engaging with the material.
