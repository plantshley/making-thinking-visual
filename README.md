# Making Thinking Visible 🌈🌟💭

Welcome to the **Making Thinking Visible** resource hub. This repository serves as your main access point for all guides, links, and technical instructions required for the semester's mental model assignments. After making your GitHub profile, star and watch this page! 

## Course Philosophy

This course focuses on building mental models to represent complex engineering concepts.

* **Experimentation & Effort over Perfection:** You are assessed on your process and attempt, not on creating a flawless masterpiece.
* **Exploration:** Use this time to explore new tools (including AI help if desired) and find what works for your thinking style.
* **No "Failing":** There is no wrong way to visualize your thoughts and mental models, provided you are engaging with the material.
